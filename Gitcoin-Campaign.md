#BitFwd GitCoin Campaign (May - July2020).

Quadrandtic Funding and Crowd Based Financing has the potential to change Venture Capital and investment systems as we know it.

GitCoin has recently become one of the most spoken about QF models inside of the cryptocurrency and public Blockchain space. With this has come alot of attention from small projects building and developing for all things Blockchain. From Sydney, Australia, 'Libra News and Talks' was birthed and is participating in a local/global initiative held by BitFwd Community, also from Sydney Australia.

In the following statement, you will find the activities and events that was held during the course of May to July 2020 from a number of participants (list below) who all engaged in the Bitfwd GitCoin Grant Campaign 2020.

###### Campaign Activites and Participants 

Libra News and Talks was created and is headed by a member of the Sydney Crypto Society. Who has specifically chosen to participate in the BitFwd Gitcoin Grant Campaign, as a member seeking investment, alliances and partnerships, while also using the opportunity to grow and expand the project from engaging with the projects participating in the campaign.

By engaging in the Bitfwd GitCoin campaign, LNATS has been given the opportunity to receive the benefits of regular communications and weekly conference calls to have, and be asked questions about the Libra News and Talks online news service. From the start of the campaign, every project has shared a comment board, see here: (Add Link). Along with transcripts from each conference call see here: (Add Link).

###### F & Q's

Some of the most Frequently Asked Questions about the Libra News and Talks project so far, have been:

What is the main subject of focus other than The Libra Blockchain?

Are you going to focus on general Cryptocurrencies aswell as the 3 pre-stated assets from economic perspective?

What do you see being the most valuable part of the current market you are going to be able to target as a online news and publication service?

Focusing on the global economy as a whole allows the platform to cover a wide range of different topics, how do you plan to manage the workload?

How are you going to distribute publications, manifests and market reports?

Other than weekly updates and transcripts (from the webinar sessions) each project has taken its own direction in terms of their own campaign. The alumni associates along with BitFwd professionals are a group of working entrepreneurs subject blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.

Each of them with their own projects and unique backgrounds. List here: • Nuts finance, • SheDAO, • DAOism, ......

By offering each other the opportunity to ask questions and relate to topics through conference calls and internet applications, they have supported and allowed each others projects to grow over the course of the Bitfwd campaign by iterating on opinions expressed during group talks and campaign webinars.

From a perspective of a project that has engaged in the program, we have found that being able to share ideas, questions and have the chance to receive opinions expressed by others, during the webinars and chatrooms. Has given the project a wider audience to work on experiencing how the Libra News And Talks decentralized online news service, can become a viable product to support the development of open banking and decentralized finance across a global spectrum.

###### Webinar Conference Transcript 

LNATS transcript section: Sofia for LNATS: 01:25:19 - 1:25:48: “LNATS seeks to deliver news and discussion on the topic of Libra and is a group of collaborators that have been paying attention to the Libra project and feel that it important to establish a source of information around Libra.”

Conor for LNATS: 01:25:48 - 1:26:58: “Yes, effectively the objective and goal of LNATS is to offer the crypto community an online multimedia news service that specifically focuses on Libra, central bank digital currencies, fintech innovations and regulatory developments related to use of digital payments and where this space is heading.
Sofia for LNATS: 01:27:00 - 1:27:39 :” You have a dual-scope value proposition there: a narrow scope of covering Libra specifically and a wider scope of covering legislative requirements and situation around fungible tokens. What made you pick Libra?”

Conor for LNATS: 01:27:40 - 1:30:20: “ Out of general interest and more to the fact that there was no informative service that supported the research behind Libra specifically and what it was trying to achieve empowering majority of Africa with a new financial infrastructure allowing them to be a part of a financial system using mobile phones or applications, which was the initial goal outlined in the Libra White paper. 

When my colleagues and I read the whitepaper we were amazed that there was no online discussion of it’s essential content fundamental to Libra’s purpose, the market that it is trying to get into, and how the banks, the governments, regulators and other fintech initiatives are tackling Libra, working with Libra, what they are doing to keep the market to themselves or are they broadening the scope and allow Libra to go upright with them as a financial services provider. So it became a topic of research for us and with that we realized that if we developed a kind of structure to the research that could then inform other communities - members of the crypto space, financial workers of the information around what is actually happening with the regulations around application development, infrastructure development, general economics of the fintech space it would be highly beneficial to not just people in crypto and people that are looking into digital payments and things like that, but generally to society as a whole. because we see the space moving quite quickly, and now we have entered a new decade and now, with Corona, health restrictions and personal health space has actually become quite a big thing so handling cash and other forms of money, or how you would exchange value that are becoming a lot more digitalised.”

Sofia for LNATS: 01:30:26 - 01:35:25: “The offering of specialising on Libra is quite niche. We are operating in a space where there are a lot of fungible tokens. Focusing exclusively on Libra could put you under a microscope in terms of neutrality of your material as well as in position of potentially polarized reception by the crypto community where the more sustainable projects succeed in delivering on needs and issues shared in the wider community and characterised by neutrality.  
 
You might also find that funding your work will depend heavily on finding alignment with funding partners and it makes sense to focus on an area that is going to be likely to align you with the majority of the audience then polarise the audience and align you with a minority. So here - your choice to do research could prove valuable, but choosing the right topic might be the key to success with actually being read. Indeed you could benefit from choosing a wider topic like: “fungible tokens in general and the relationship between them and the centralised governments of our nation states”.
