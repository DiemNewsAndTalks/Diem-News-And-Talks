# BitFwd GitCoin Campaign (May - July2020).

## Introduction.

Quadrandtic Funding and Crowd Based Financing has the potential to change Venture Capital and investment systems as we know it.

GitCoin has recently become one of the most spoken about QF models inside of the cryptocurrency and public Blockchain space. With this has come alot of attention from small projects building and developing for all things Blockchain. From Sydney, Australia, 'Libra News and Talks' was birthed and is participating in a local/global initiative held by BitFwd Community, also from Sydney Australia.

In the following statement, you will find the activities and events that was held during the course of May to July 2020 from a number of participants (list below) who all engaged in the Bitfwd GitCoin Grant Campaign 2020.

## Campaign Activites and Participants.

Libra News and Talks was created and is headed by a member of the Sydney Crypto Society. Who has specifically chosen to participate in the BitFwd Gitcoin Grant Campaign, as a member seeking investment, alliances and partnerships, while also using the opportunity to grow and expand the project from engaging with the projects participating in the campaign.

By engaging in the Bitfwd GitCoin campaign, LNATS has been given the opportunity to receive the benefits of regular communications and weekly conference calls to have, and be asked questions about the Libra News and Talks online news service. From the start of the campaign, every project has shared a comment board, along with transcripts from each conference call (See Below).

Other than consitant conversation, weekly updates and transcripts (from the webinar sessions, see below) each project has taken its own direction in terms of their own campaign. The alumni associates along with BitFwd professionals are a group of working entrepreneurs subject blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.


## LNATS Campaign Draft Board. 

 1) Origin Story.

**- How was the project born:** *The initial inception of LNATS was occupied by the movement of decentralised finance (DeFi) and the production of Facebook's Libra stablecoin project.*

**- What made it seem important:** *As global economics continue to decline so does the value of the currencies supporting them. Libra is offering a new payment system to the world and aiming to empower Billions of users. Providing online communities with the necessary information and market updates on regulations and procedures, that make stablecoins legitimate in the economy is the foundational structure for the LNATS service.*

**- What connected the founders:** *The founders of the project are community members and local leaders within the crypto industry.*

**- How did the project evolve into what it is today:** *Using social media and other various forms of online communications, LNATS has been piloted specifically by web technologies and online communities.*

2) Problem Definition.

**- What's going on that is not right:** *Currently the crypto currency markets are under regulated and illegitimate because of their inherit nature of being decentralised and free from governement censorship. This means they are tough to regulate and need regulatory approval to be functional financial products. This needs to change along with applied standards to digital assets.*

**- How did come about and what does it lead too:** *After the release of Libra's v1.0 of their white paper the project was out of stealth and not much was around on the internet in terms of publications, news and updates around the project. This was seen as a sandbox for a number of reasons to begin researching and writing about the project.*

**- How did you discover the problem:** *We initially discovered that there was no online communities focusing specifically on stablecoins and CBDC after 4 weeks of the release of Libra's white paper. Plus there are no projects logging the regulators movements in crypto.*

**- How are you going to solve the problem:** *To ensure that the online communities and businesses around the world are up to date and dijesting the latest information on market updates and regulations around CBDC, Libra and other stablecoin projects. Libra News and Talks is going to use social media, online publications and data driven analyst to give it's users a comprehensive range of diluted information to ensure legitimate educational insights are gained. Also we will offer resources such as newsletters and podcasts and interviews from industry leaders to solve dark shadow being cast over Libra by the regulators, governemnts and its rivals.*

3) Value Proposition.

**- What are you building:** *Libra News and Talks is a online initiative focused on providing the latest news, updates, market insights, resources and regulations surrounding Facebook's Libra, CBDC and Stable Crypto Tokens.*

**- What does your project seek to accomplish:** *By using social media networks, online publications and communities with other resources outside of grouped initiatives. LNATS is aiming to become a hub for all things relating to Libra, Central Bank Digital Currencies and Stablecoin projects.*

**- How will you solve the problem:** *With focusing attention towards traditional financial services and extending the views expressed over to the crypto markets, we will be able to offer and exchange valuable information on regulations and market standards along with a economic analysis. To ensure that we solve the problem of the dark cloud hanging over the legitimacy of Libra, CBDCs and Stablecoins. Furthermore our platform will provide technical support for all related projects.* 

**- How will it impact a greater community:** *As a financial product, Cryptocurrencies are tailored to meet life's everyday needs by allowing two parties to enxhange value across a network, being able to impact a wider audience than the current users of digital assets. Will require the project to achieve a marketing status on a global scale. Also by using online forums, project native newsletters and engaging in potential partnerships, the project will look to impact a wider following by providing market statistics and informational resources to all age groups.*

4) Stakeholder Roles and Outcomes.

**- The Team:** *Currently the team operating Libra News and Talks is consisting of no more than 5 members on a weekly rota.*

**- The community:** *The community behind the LNATS project is a group of people from around the globe that communicate online, with also a few other local initiatives from Oceania collaborating on the project.*

**- The benefactors:** *Anyone who chooses to use the platform as a means of professional and educational resources to Libra, CBDC and Stablecoin projects.*

By offering each other the opportunity to ask questions and relate to topics through conference calls and internet applications, they have supported and allowed each others projects to grow over the course of the Bitfwd campaign by iterating on opinions expressed during group talks and campaign webinars.

From a perspective of a project that has engaged in the program, we have found that being able to share ideas, questions and have the chance to receive opinions expressed by others, during the webinars and chatrooms. Has given the project a wider audience to work on experiencing how the Libra News And Talks decentralized online news service, can become a viable product to support the development of open banking and decentralized finance across a global spectrum.

## F & Q's Libra News And Talks.

Some of the most Frequently Asked Questions about the Libra News and Talks project so far, have been - 

What is the main subject of focus other than The Libra Blockchain?

*Other than the Libra Blockchain, LNATS decentralised social new platformn is focused on providing insights, to the growth and potential of the use of Central Bank Digital Currencies and Stable Crypto Token projects. By means of servicing the need for information towards the applicability of digital assets to the tradtional fiat economy, and how they can play a role in the future of the financial industry.*

Are you going to focus on general Cryptocurrencies aswell as the 3 pre-stated assets from economic perspective?

*Yes, the general aspects of Libra News And Talks is to be able to provide insights into the movement of Decentralised Finance, by supporting the cryptocurrency industry as a whole but specifically, we will be focused mainly on the Libra Blockchain, Central Bank Digital Currencies and Stable Crypto Tokens.*

What do you see being the most valuable part of the current market you are going to be able to target as a online news and publication service?

*As a news service provider, the most vaulable part of the financial market for Libra News And Talks is going to be how economies, and business operations are able to benefit from the use of digital assets and blockchain technology. This means that the profitability of the project will come from the information derived from research and analysis of the markets behaviour and the global spectrum of the Decentralised Finance movement.*

Focusing on the global economy as a whole allows the platform to cover a wide range of different topics, how do you plan to manage the workload?

*With a multiple range of topics to cover other than Libra, Central Bank Digital Currencies and Stable Crypto Tokens. We anticipate that the workload being placed upon the LNATS decentralised social news platform is going to be managed through the platforms research commission. Which is specifically aimed at breaking down our 3 main points of focus into sub-sections and sub-points, to develop and build a diverse informative set of publications, manifests and online profiles for users to engage with to educate and inform themselves upon the chosen points of interest.* 

How are you going to distribute publications, manifests and market reports?

*To distribute and publicize the platforms information, Libra News And Talks is going to use social media profiles, online publications, e-mails and pre-written documnents that will be uploaded to the LNATS website, along with messaging channels and forums to further enhance the conversation being generated around our market reports, manifests and documentations. Using these multiple choice senarios for users to retrive information from, allows LNATS to distribute our documentations accordingly to the users preferences.*

## Webinar Conference Transcript (LNATS).

LNATS transcript section: Sofia for LNATS: 01:25:19 - 1:25:48: *“LNATS seeks to deliver news and discussion on the topic of Libra and is a group of collaborators that have been paying attention to the Libra project and feel that it important to establish a source of information around Libra.”*

Conor for LNATS: 01:25:48 - 1:26:58: *“Yes, effectively the objective and goal of LNATS is to offer the crypto community an online multimedia news service that specifically focuses on Libra, central bank digital currencies, fintech innovations and regulatory developments related to use of digital payments and where this space is heading."*
Sofia for LNATS: 01:27:00 - 1:27:39 : *”You have a dual-scope value proposition there: a narrow scope of covering Libra specifically and a wider scope of covering legislative requirements and situation around fungible tokens. What made you pick Libra?”*

Conor for LNATS: 01:27:40 - 1:30:20: *“Out of general interest and more to the fact that there was no informative service that supported the research behind Libra specifically and what it was trying to achieve empowering majority of Africa with a new financial infrastructure allowing them to be a part of a financial system using mobile phones or applications, which was the initial goal outlined in the Libra White paper. "*

*When my colleagues and I read the whitepaper we were amazed that there was no online discussion of it’s essential content fundamental to Libra’s purpose, the market that it is trying to get into, and how the banks, the governments, regulators and other fintech initiatives are tackling Libra, working with Libra, what they are doing to keep the market to themselves or are they broadening the scope and allow Libra to go upright with them as a financial services provider. So it became a topic of research for us and with that we realized that if we developed a kind of structure to the research that could then inform other communities - members of the crypto space, financial workers of the information around what is actually happening with the regulations around application development, infrastructure development, general economics of the fintech space it would be highly beneficial to not just people in crypto and people that are looking into digital payments and things like that, but generally to society as a whole. because we see the space moving quite quickly, and now we have entered a new decade and now, with Corona, health restrictions and personal health space has actually become quite a big thing so handling cash and other forms of money, or how you would exchange value that are becoming a lot more digitalised.”*

Sofia for LNATS: 01:30:26 - 01:35:25: *“The offering of specialising on Libra is quite niche. We are operating in a space where there are a lot of fungible tokens. Focusing exclusively on Libra could put you under a microscope in terms of neutrality of your material as well as in position of potentially polarized reception by the crypto community where the more sustainable projects succeed in delivering on needs and issues shared in the wider community and characterised by neutrality.* 
 
*You might also find that funding your work will depend heavily on finding alignment with funding partners and it makes sense to focus on an area that is going to be likely to align you with the majority of the audience then polarise the audience and align you with a minority. So here - your choice to do research could prove valuable, but choosing the right topic might be the key to success with actually being read. Indeed you could benefit from choosing a wider topic like: “fungible tokens in general and the relationship between them and the centralised governments of our nation states”.*

Vandal for LNATS 01:35:26 - 1:36:18: *"A few years back I discovered a project called “Humanic” and they were planning to bank the unbanked just like you are suggesting that Libra wants to do. Their central focus was and still is in Africa and they are a decentralised project, they were doing events, onboarding, microloans, small business funding, empowering the unbanked utilizing crypto and fungible tokens as a means of exchange on their app, so if Africa is an area of interest for you - you might find them interesting."*

Conor for LNATS 01:36:37: *“Yes please. Indeed we targeted Libra specifically because of the use-case, but at the same time the neutrality of information and alignment with the audience are important to us and we realise that the bigger picture is at play."*
