* Automation 

Automation in Banking gives the services being offered from the industry to have a automatic approach to dealing with customers and data structures which are developed from 
the exchnage in arbitary pieces of necessasry information who create the Banks digital network. Providing the ability to automate unique and individual assignments created from the goods and services being offered from institutional and retail monetary outlets. Artifical intelligence and other innovative solutions to fin-tech like Blockchain technology bring forward the process of reliable transmissions of information exchange regarding brokerage and consumption of the goods and services given from the Banks applications. The main state of automation is to enhance to process of order books and watch counts for outstanding liabilities which effect the Banks potential to maintain financial stability and bring foward monetary services to consumers. As the Bank creates a portfolio of information which carries value across it's network, the liableness of redundancy in payments increases as the exspansion of input and output exspectancy grows in house. The Bank needs to allow for more efficient transmissions of input which carry in prospect the potential of better services and automation brings forward the expectancy of greater data transmission which in return relies on the Blockchain for storage and consumption.

A strategic transformation that delivers the full benefits of automation should be based on six building blocks:

1) **Develop the end state vision and strategy.** Successful banks develop a bank-wide vision for the future, reimagining how they will be organized and how work will get done—both with the automation capabilities that exist today and those on the horizon. They focus on automating the processes that are essential to their long-term competitiveness, and turn to vendors for the processes they expect to become commodities (for example, routine finance functions, basic reporting). Banks should begin with a rapid diagnostic to assess the full value at stake, define organizational aspirations, and develop a high-level implementation sequencing, or roadmap, to achieving those aspirations. Banks should not hesitate to set ambitious targets, aiming to lower costs by more than a third and turn their restructured cost base into a competitive advantage.
Set up a small central team. 

2) **Putting a well-run center of excellence (COE) in place early is critical to the long-term automation effort.** A COE administers the enterprise-wide approach to transformation, and plays a number of critical roles, from managing vendor relationships to building capabilities and interfacing with the business and critical support functions—in particular IT and human resources. There are many potential designs for a COE. A key consideration is the center’s capabilities, which should include not only technical capabilities, but those needed to reimagine groups and organizations, redefine how people will work with technology, work with multiple stakeholders across the bank, and translate new ways of working into measurable efficiencies. These capabilities will enable the bank to adopt—and adapt to—future technologies.

3) **Ensure IT is a partner.** In most cases, automation at scale needs to be sponsored by each individual business and function, but a close partnership with IT is particularly important. IT designs the overall systems lifecycle, manages the rollout against IT priorities, supports development, and performs ongoing maintenance. A successful partnership thus requires early and ongoing engagement with IT through a program steering committee and governance structures.

4) **Focus on human resources.** The people changes associated with implementing automation at scale—and realizing its full value—are substantial. New automation technologies will touch on many different roles within the bank, and employees will need to learn new ways of working. While automation can have significant benefits in terms of risk, revenues, and client experience, many efforts will also automate work that is currently being done by people. HR therefore plays an essential role, creating new workforce-management practices, proactively managing changes, and using analytics to plan and coordinate the redeployment and reskilling of employees. Working closely with HR from the beginning is thus essential. Many organizations are taking advantage of shifting workforce demographics to minimize forced exits, seeing automation as an opportunity to fill holes in the workforce that are emerging naturally.

5) **Create detailed roadmaps and anoint change champions.** Though some of the implementation of new automation capabilities will take place relatively quickly, banks will spend several years rolling out the transformation across all businesses and support functions. To succeed in the long term, they need a clear plan for each business and function, as well as for the entire enterprise. Without it, they can continue to experiment without developing a view of the overall opportunity.
By focusing on one area and creating a detailed roadmap, banks can avoid paralysis, get all stakeholders involved, and make the initial area a “change champion” that will build excitement and rally the enterprise with an inspiring narrative. Such early deployments can also be used to train the businesses and functions that implement later. Additional ways to achieve follow-up success include secondments, go-and-see events and the sharing of learnings through the COE.

6) **Carefully choose the first pilot area.** The first business or function chosen for an automation pilot will be crucial, as it—and its leaders—will ideally become the initial change champion for the entire automation effort. While the size of the opportunity and the ease of implementation are important, having the right leaders as sponsors for the initiative is critical to success. When selecting the first pilot area banks should consider the energy level and commitment of the business’s leader, the level of respect she commands in the organization, and other initiatives the business has in progress that may help or hinder the work. Most banks also choose to start in a middle- or back-office area to avoid customer-facing processes and riskier areas during trials. Initial areas of focus in finance would include accounts payable, reconciliations, template processes, and reporting (exhibit).

Automation at scale refers to the employment of an emerging set of technologies that combines fundamental process redesign with robotic process automation (RPA) and machine learning. Automation at scale encompasses the following five core technologies.

1) RPA allows companies to configure computer software to automate routine tasks such as data extraction and cleaning through existing user interfaces, mimicking human actions.

2) Smart workflow is a process-management software tool that merges tasks performed by groups of humans and machines to integrate robots into the daily flow of work.

3) Machine learning and advanced analytics software use algorithms to identify patterns in structured and unstructured data. These technologies mimic human judgment.

4) Natural-language generation is accomplished by software engines that create seamless interactions between humans and technology, translating observations from data into prose. These technologies mimic human speech.

5) Cognitive agents are created by combining machine learning and natural-language generation to build virtual workers (or “agents”) capable of executing tasks, communicating, learning from data sets and making decisions based on logic, experiential learning and, in some cases, the detection of customer emotions.
