# Diem Blockchain Hub

A resoucres file for all things related to interacting with Diem Blockchain specifically under use of terminal applications and generalised state purpose activity.

## Contents

*1: Protocol overview*

###### Key concepts of the Diem Blockchain.

* Diem is a blockchain based on distributed ledger technology using the two-tierd approach for designing the transfer of computation across the network of participants.

* Using full nodes and validators sets to authenticate the networks latent execution of valued information between nodes, the have chosen to take a BFT approach to maintaining
consensus between the two sets of authoritze particicpants in the blockchains system. Meaning that 2/3rds of nodes will always have a verified state of the networks whole ledger whos storage holds the most recent state of the Diem blockchain.

* Accounts are able to carry multiple peices of data when stored on the ledgers state. 

* The validators of the network provide API calls from the corresponding connections of full nodes that are operating the party members of Diem's network.

* The transfer of Diem tokens is first validated from a memory pool of pending transactions which validator nodes choose to add as new executed arbitary function calls and state changes to the Diem ledger.

*2: Diem nodes*

###### Introduction to validator and full nodes.

* A Diem node is a peer entity of the Diem ecosystem that tracks the state of the Diem Blockchain. Clients interact with the blockchain via Diem nodes. 

* There are two types of nodes:

  Validator Nodes (Validators) FullNodes

* Each Diem node comprises several logical components:

  JSON-RPC service

  Mempool

  Storage

  Consensus (only validators)

  Execution

  State synchronizer

  Virtual machine

*3: Accounts*

###### Introduction to account creation, keys, addresses and currencies.

*4: Gas*

###### Learn how the Diem payment network uses gas to charge a transaction fee.

*5: Events*

###### Event types and how to query them.

*6: Diem Clients*

###### An overview of Diem clients.


###### *Transactions*

*7: Transaction Types*

###### Overview of creation/minting administration and payments.

*8: Life of a transaction*

###### Follow a transactions from submission to being committed to the Diem Blockchain.

*9: My first transaction* 

###### Create and execute your first Diem transaction.
