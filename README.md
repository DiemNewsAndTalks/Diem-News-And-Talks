By using three different accounts, the project has been able to gain access to the potential marketing expenses for the project and also the design of the service from a range of different angles. Which in return has allowed LNATS to develop targeted pencentages of growth of around 7/8% per quarter through, general information hand outs and basic functionality. The initial time consumption of expanding the projects base layer with regular updates, questions and serveys being given to the community currently consists of around, 15-20 hours per week (per person).

Generating more business from the platform(LNATS) means that the service has to have a model for fungibility within the flow of operational dynamics. Because of this 'The Libra News and Talks Research Commission' has been created as an object specific task force. Dedicated to providing the Libra News and Talks online news service, with the information required to build the project into a fully functioning economic entity and competently recognised industry model. See the Whitepaper for more information on how the Libra News And Talks Research Commission is built to provide and support the LNATS news service.
