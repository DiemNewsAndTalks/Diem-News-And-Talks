## 3: Libra News and Talks.

Over the course of the last decade, technology advancements in financial services and web based products have sky rocketed into the market for the general public. Bringing with them un-stoppable innovations like Cryptocurrencies and public blockchain networks that offer the opportunity, to send money to anyone in the world at a fraction of the cost of traditional financial service providers like Western Union, IBS (International Bank of Settlements), SWIFT (The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication), and various other international payment service providers.

During the development of these products the world has experienced the rise of a new form of asset that is secured and managed by blockchain technology (These assets or as they are mostly referred to crypto tokens or currencies). Allow for users to store, send and receive a digital representation of value, across a distributed digital network, free from censorship and manipulation. Which has attracted a wide variety use cases in finance. Because users are now able to avoid third party custodians, and legal constituents when executing a transfer of value across borders and inbetween nation states. 

- *These new networks of public/private Blockchains and cryptocurrencies have given birth to the rise of a war, against the use of fiat currencies and cash as we know it.*

In last June (2019) Facebook released their first white paper for a stablecoin initiative called “Libra” which is aiming to provide financial inclusion and monetary stability to Billions of people around the world. By offering them a digital alternative to traditional forms of money, users of The Libra Blockchain will be able to avoid high fees when sending money overseas, and be able to manage their finances on a public blockchain network instead of using a Central, Commercial or High-Street Bank.

The project had initally sparked a fire inside of the US Central Banking system and many others around the globe, since it’s initial inception last June. Since then regulators from the US, EU, Australia, China, Switerzland, The Middle East and other regions have stood against the spirit of The Libra Blockchain, by imposing tribunal dates and restrictions on how the project is able to operate. In the birth of the commotion Libra News And Talks was born to not only support the initiative, but also to provide information and insights on Libra's rivalling projects, community thoughts and market analysis, through using online social platforms.

With the above key features, Libra News And Talks is able to exchange services and extend its products to other communities around, forming partnerships and alliances along the way. Aiming to educate and inform it’s user base, the experience of interacting and using the Libra News And Talks platform is something anyone will enjoy and gain new learnings from. Focusing on decentralized finance and Cryptocurrencies, its main objective is to become an educational news hub for research, and the development of Facebook's Libra, Central Bank Digital Currencies and Stable Crypto Token initiatives.
